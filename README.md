# Ayro

I made this program in order to get parameters from the end-user and then browsing twice to the same URL and saving its layout (DOM) and performing comparisons on that URL by checking for changes, deletions and insertions in requested url.

please make sure to notice that this program has test sections where I addded various 'unit tests' in order to check different functionalities of the program.

Please be adviced to the following instructions:

1. when you type a url address please use the following convention: 'www.<URL>' for example: www.google.com.
2. this project can be imported as Maven project. 
3. you can import the project as is. 
  
# Enjoy!!!
